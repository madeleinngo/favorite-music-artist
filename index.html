          <p>
            "Local Sound" is a movement born from within the Nashville-based
            college ministry, MyLocal. Their identity is found in the hope of
            Jesus Christ and as key holders to the kingdom of heaven, doing
            whatever it takes to bring people to Jesus by glorifying God with
            all that they have.

              I like these lyrics from their song "Shepherd" because it is based
              on Psalm 23 from the Bible, a psalm that is personally a source of
              strength for me.

              I also like that Local Sound wrote it like this, from the point of
              view of the sheep because it helps with the feel of the song,
              which is inspirational and moving.
